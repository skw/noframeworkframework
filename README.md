# NOFRAMEWORKFRAMEWORK

It's time to toss frameworks out the window. But before we do that we must
understand what a framework is.

## What is a framework?
It depends on who you ask. From a traditional point of view it's a set of
boundries where in programs can communicate with each other. Shell, Node and
HTTP are examples of frameworks. These frameworks are usually focused on
_protocols_.

Nowadays a framework means something else: a set of libraries that trade
flexibility for convenience, usually coupled with the promise of efficiency.
It's these type of frameworks that we want to throw out.
